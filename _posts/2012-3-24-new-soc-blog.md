{% include JB/setup %}

Setup the new blog using Jekyll so everything can be hosted
out of git. It seems a little strange considering my background
with drupal, but seems to be doing the job.

This blog is where students will post their updates.  Where things will
be announced, etc.  Please feel free to follow along here, updates will
also probably be cross posted from our [tumblr blog](http://simplecv.tumblr.com)
