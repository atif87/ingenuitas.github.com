Project Title: Panrama/Image Stitching

Overview: Create a system that stitches successive images taken from an assembly line into a single image. I want to extend this capability to other applications such as a panorama stitching system. I am also interested in the other projects mentioned in your sites including Intermediate extensions to SimpleCV. I am really interested in the contribution towards simplecv libraries. I have made some games in Computer Graphics. I have also done projects in Opencv for the segmentations of cricket video. I have a research background and have a publications in IEEE conference. 

Motivation:

I am a student of computer vision and really passionate about the field. I am interested in the open source projects.
If we are taking some paronomic views of a scene, this degrades the quality of the image if the camera is shaken slightly. I want 
to create it in such a way that if there is vibrations, it wont affect the quality.

Deliverables:

An image stitching software, which can be used to stich image for the paronomic views. 

Remarks:

This tools will be helpful in the image stictching and for the paronomic images.
Timeline:

April 20 to May 25:
* Start to talk with the mentor(s) about the project.
* Learning from them about SimpleCV.
* Find, analyse and implement the current image stitching algorithms. 
* Learning to code for SimpleCV. 

May 25 to June 30:
* Start of the implementation of the Ideas,
* Compare the results with current Image stitiching algorithm implemented. 

July 1 to July 10:
* Preparing an overview for the mid-term evaluation

July 10 to August 20:
* Taking action with the result of the mid-term evaluation.

August 31:
* Announce module to SimpleCV community

Future:

After the Summer, we can imagine to create a way permitting everyone, with review procedure to add examples
to the tools.
