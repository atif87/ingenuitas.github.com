Project Title: Tutorial within a GUI

Overview: Make an user Friendly tutorial with interactive action and simple
button to make quick and simple apps.

Motivation:

The most common problems in tutorial, is that there is a lot of words but not much examples, here it's all about
examples. But it want be just a plain text document with piece of code everywere, this will be within a Graphic
Interface showing step-by-step code. Making the learning of Simple Vision as user-friendly as possible.

Deliverables:

This project deserve to give SimpleCV a tool permitting to new users to discover SimpleCV, with plenty of examples
all this within a PyQt interface to make it more useable.

Remarks:

I think that such a tools can help SimpleCV to touch more persons, and to make the lerning of Computer Vision simples, in convincing people
that there is not just OpenCV with all his tools, methods, keywords, and so. But also a Python framework easy to use and easy to learn.
Timeline:

April 20 to June 20:
* Start to talk with the mentor(s) about the project.
* Learning from them and other source more on Computer Vision
* Find the examples that will be developped.
* Discuss with Community about them and how it's the best to make them.
* Creating the layout of the GUI

June 20 to July 10:
* Start of the implementation of the examples

July 10 to July 15:
* Preparing an overview for the mid-term evaluation

July 16 to August 20:
* Taking action with the result of the mid-term evaluation.
* Creating the tools for Quick Coding (Buttons, ...).

August 31:
* Announce module to SimpleCV community

Future:

After the Summer, we can imagine to create a way permitting everyone, with review procedure to add examples
to the tools.

About Me:

I am currently making a Bachelor in the Brussels University, Belgium in Computer Sciences. I am completly new in the world of Computer Vision but I am very motivate as from all I have seen the world of Computer Vision is really vast and interesting.

I have a good knowledge of Python (2 and 3) as it is the basis language of this study. I can understand C++ code, and I always like to discover new language, new prommaming tools, new branch of them. It is in this kind of démarche that I find SimpleCV.
