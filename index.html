        <h2>Google Summer of Code (GSoC) with SimpleCV</h2>

        <p>
        SimpleCV is happy to announce its participation in the 2012 <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a>. We are looking for up to three talented students who want to become experts in computer vision and Python and work with a top-notch team on professional open-source development.
        </p>
        <hr>
        You must submit your application through the Google Summer of Code website (NOTE THAT APPLICATIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED BY GOOGLE UNTIL 3/26/2012). We cannot take applications directly.
        <hr>

        <h3>Who are we looking for?</h3>

        <p>
        We are looking for talented undergraduate and graduate students who want to help us change the landscape of Computer Vision by creating user-friendly interfaces to making computers see. We are also looking for candidates that may not be from a computer vision background, but would like to apply computer vision to solve practical problems in the sciences and further their research domain. A good candidate student should have interest in any or all of the following computer science sub-disciplines: computer graphics, computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and signal processing. The student should also be scientifically minded - computer vision is a data driven field where results must be analyzed and quantified. Students should also be interested and motivated to construct the hardware necessary to collect imagery data, and build innovative applications that interact with the real world. 
        </p> 


        <h3>What skills will you need?</h3>
        <p>
        For our beginner and intermediate projects we expect each student to have some programming experience, and while we prefer that it would be in Python and C++, we do not require it. Python is really easy to learn and we will teach you everything you need to know, all we expect is that you have basic programming experience (i.e. at least one year of college programming courses). An understanding of computer graphics, computer vision, linear algebra, signal processing, and machine learning techniques will be helpful tools, but again they are by no means required. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Our advanced projects  require that the student be familiar with C++ and Python and have some passing familiarity with linear algebra, signal processing, 3D geometry, and potentially computer graphics. For these projects we are looking for undergraduate seniors and graduate students. 
        </p>

        <h3>What will your summer be like?</h3>

        <p>
        After an initial discussion with the student we will devise a project plan that meets the students learning objectives, and works to improve the functionality of SimpleCV. Since we aim to support all of the common operating systems students will be allowed to develop code on any platform and use whatever development environments suits them best. If you are local, we strongly encourage students to spend the summer at our Ann Arbor, Michigan office.  Our goal, for each of our students, is to be able to create an end-to-end example that will have real-world applications and show their code in action by the end of the summer. This can be accomplished by working on a single large project in the case of the advanced students, or as set of complimentary features for students just learning vision technologies. 
        </p> 


        <h3>What a day looks like at SimpleCV</h3>

        <p>
        We have daily stand-up meetings and weekly planning google hangout meetings, plus ad-hoc 1 on 1 meetings.  At our weekly planning meetings you will plan your week and generate tickets for both your coding tasks and research tasks. During our daily stand-up meetings we will review your progress and discuss and problems you may have. You will also be able to contact us at any time via email, gchat, #simplecv on freenode IRC, and voice. In addition to coding tasks each student will be expected to generate tests, documentation, and examples for each module they complete. Students should also expect to take an active role in our user community, answer forum and list questions pertaining to their work, and publishing their progress online.
        </p>        

 
        <h3>Who will I be working with?</h3>

        <p>
        You will be working with the primary SimpleCV developers:
        <ul>
          <li><a href='http://www.linkedin.com/pub/katherine-scott/b/480/2a7'>Katherine Scott</a></li>
          <li><a href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/nateoostendorp'>Nate Oostendorp</a></li>
          <li><a href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonyoliver'>Anthony Oliver</a></li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>What sort of projects can I do?</h3>

        <h4>Beginner Projects</h4>

        <ul>
        <li>
        Learn python by helping others learn python - we are always in need of good examples. The student will spend the summer writing examples of how to use SimpleCV with other python libraries. This will culminate in the student assistant teaching a class using their examples at a hacker space or local university.
        </li>

        <li>
        Basic extensions to SimpleCV - the student will propose and implement a set of features from our current open feature tickets plus any approaches the student might be interested in examining. For example, if the student is interested in color correction, they could implement a variety of color correction routines and then quantify the results. See our existing tickets to get a feel for current problems: <a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/simplecv/tickets/'>https://sourceforge.net/p/simplecv/tickets/</a>
        </li>

        </ul>

  
        <h4>Intermediate Projects</h4>

        <ul>
        <li>
        Intermediate extensions to SimpleCV - the student will propose and implement a set of complimentary features in SimpleCV working from our existing list of tickets and the students own interests. Example projects include building a web development interface, Â§improving our machine learning library, or integrating an augmented reality system with SimpleCV.
        </li>

        <li>
        Panorama / Image Stitching - create a system that stitches successive images taken from an assembly line into a single image. The student will then extend this capability to other applications such as a panorama stitching system. 
        </li>

        <li>
        Improved Rendering - replace our current PyGame based rendering system with a system that can use either a Qt console or render interactively to a web-browser. Along these lines a student could choose to further integrate SimpleCV with the ipython web-notebook. 
        </li>

        <li>
        Tracking - the student will extend our current feature libraries to allow them to track objects temporally between frames successive frames. Complimentary methods include appearance matching, Kalman filtering, and OpenTLD (<a href='https://github.com/zk00006/OpenTLD'>https://github.com/zk00006/OpenTLD)</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
        Pick-to-Light System - for this project the student will create a pick-to-light system using a kinect sensor, a projector, and an optional camera. Pick-to-light systems drive order fulfillment systems at places like Amazon and McMaster-Carr. These systems cost in excess of $100 an item to install. We would like to write an open-source software package that provides this capability for free. Other applications include robotic user interfaces, interactive games, and artistic expression. See <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emSHkvIgqSM'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emSHkvIgqSM</a>
        </li>

        </ul>

      <h4>Advanced Projects</h4>

      <ul>
      <li>
      We would like to build and open-source hardware / software system for performing 3D laser scanning and structured light analysis. While there are source code repositories for such systems, none of them present a complete solution where a user can scan an object and generate a mesh model that can be printed on a 3D printed or used in a video game. We would like to create a set of python tools that make this process exceptionally easy. All project hardware will be consumer off the shelf and of minimal cost. 
      </li>

      <li>
      We are also willing to assist with any project that pertains to applying computer vision technology to fundamental research in the sciences. Interested graduate students are encouraged to work with their advisor to submit a research and development plan to create an open-source systems that expedites research or replaces costly proprietary software. For example, we have worked closely with graduate students at Harvard to create a system that tracks and quantifies research animals behavior.
