2012-03-23T15:20:58  <LeLouch16> Yes, I tried to trace the error and it seems to occur when cv.Resize function is called
2012-03-23T15:20:58  *** rishipyth has quit IRC
2012-03-23T15:22:33  <xamox> victsou_, Do you have much experience with git?
2012-03-23T15:23:08  <victsou_> I guess you just found out I don't , hehe
2012-03-23T15:23:18  <victsou_> I have a friend with very, very much experience
2012-03-23T15:23:21  <victsou_> he's been helping me
2012-03-23T15:23:22  <xamox> victsou_, not a big deal.  I like the direction you are heading.
2012-03-23T15:23:30  <xamox> victsou_, yeah, creating a new branch is always a good idea
2012-03-23T15:23:49  <xamox> victsou_, we typically have a convention where we name our branch our new feature we are adding
2012-03-23T15:23:58  <victsou_> I followed katherine's suggestion and started off a branch that was supposed to be merged soon
2012-03-23T15:24:00  <victsou_> grab_cutt
2012-03-23T15:24:02  <victsou_> grab_cut
2012-03-23T15:24:08  <victsou_> oh, yeah xamox
2012-03-23T15:24:19  <xamox> victsou_, that way code doesn't get mixed up, for instance I notice you have uploads fixed and the logging in the same branch
2012-03-23T15:24:19  <victsou_> that makes sense
2012-03-23T15:24:49  <xamox> victsou_, So what you would probably want do is make a new branch, add the upload code
2012-03-23T15:24:56  <xamox> Then you can submit a pull request to us
2012-03-23T15:25:08  <xamox> That's basically how I will know your code is ready to be looked at
2012-03-23T15:25:25  <xamox> In the mean time you can always create a new branch (normally always from master)
2012-03-23T15:25:37  <victsou_> So I should clone master and add the upload code, right?
2012-03-23T15:25:42  <xamox> Well
2012-03-23T15:25:43  <xamox> It's okay now
2012-03-23T15:25:48  <xamox> But in the future
2012-03-23T15:25:54  <victsou_> oh, I get it
2012-03-23T15:25:56  <victsou_> sure thing
2012-03-23T15:25:59  <xamox> So those branches can be validated
2012-03-23T15:26:04  <xamox> For instance your upload code may work
2012-03-23T15:26:10  <xamox> But your logging code might not
2012-03-23T15:26:23  <xamox> I know I can merge from that single commit
2012-03-23T15:26:42  <xamox> But for upstream things, like latter, if you need to merge back into the logging branch it will cause issues
2012-03-23T15:28:09  <victsou_> xamox, you're look at old code
2012-03-23T15:28:14  <victsou_> I removed the public api key there
2012-03-23T15:28:20  <victsou_> So key=none would'nt work
2012-03-23T15:28:22  <xamox> haha
2012-03-23T15:28:23  <xamox> Okay
2012-03-23T15:28:24  <xamox> Sorry
2012-03-23T15:28:32  <xamox> Whoops
2012-03-23T15:28:36  <xamox> But that is a good example
2012-03-23T15:28:50  <xamox> Kind of when you add a feature, then I can validate just that function
2012-03-23T15:28:58  <xamox> victsou_, ;)
2012-03-23T15:29:08  <victsou_> yeah, got it =D
2012-03-23T15:29:10  <xamox> so like if that was in the upload branch
2012-03-23T15:29:16  <xamox> Then you issue a pull request
2012-03-23T15:29:28  <xamox> I know you just want me to check that stuff you changed and maybe not worry about logging
2012-03-23T15:29:45  <victsou_> Nono, I wanted to go into logging too
2012-03-23T15:29:54  <xamox> It also speeds up development process, so I can get your upload code into master, while you work on logging
2012-03-23T15:30:02  <xamox> victsou_, yeah, I'm looking at that too
2012-03-23T15:30:02  <victsou_> oh
2012-03-23T15:30:07  <victsou_> oh yeah
2012-03-23T15:30:12  <victsou_> thank you xamox
2012-03-23T15:30:13  <xamox> victsou_, I hope I'm not confusing you
2012-03-23T15:30:17  <victsou_> no you're not
2012-03-23T15:30:22  <xamox> victsou_, You are doing the correct thing
2012-03-23T15:30:26  <victsou_> question:
2012-03-23T15:30:38  <victsou_> https://github.com/victsou/SimpleCV/commit/e28b43f2837a9ff50301d77ed6e3642e783ba829
2012-03-23T15:30:42  <victsou_> (last commit about the upload thing)
2012-03-23T15:30:47  <victsou_> Does that need any changes?
2012-03-23T15:30:51  <victsou_> You commented on the older one
2012-03-23T15:34:36  <xamox> victsou_, no, looking at the updated code
2012-03-23T15:35:02  <victsou_> alrighty!
2012-03-23T15:37:37  <xamox> victsou_, is pycurl part of the standard python lib?
2012-03-23T15:38:04  <victsou_> nope, xamox
2012-03-23T15:38:24  <victsou_> thought it was somewhere on the project already, though
2012-03-23T15:38:38  <victsou_> idk
2012-03-23T15:38:41  <victsou_> but no, it isn't
2012-03-23T15:39:39  <xamox> victsou_, okay, n/m I saw that you removed it later
2012-03-23T15:39:48  <xamox> victsou_, looks like you are going down the correct path for logging I would say
2012-03-23T15:39:53  <victsou_> xamox:
2012-03-23T15:40:10  <victsou_> init_logging is not supposed to be called by the user
2012-03-23T15:40:22  <victsou_> is called when the shell is inititating
2012-03-23T15:40:45  <victsou_> should I write autodoc for it too?
2012-03-23T15:40:50  <xamox> no, that was for
2012-03-23T15:40:54  <xamox> get_log_level
2012-03-23T15:41:19  <victsou_> oh, same thing
2012-03-23T15:41:29  <victsou_> that doesn't retrieve the current log_level
2012-03-23T15:41:48  <victsou_> just deals with the variable given to set_logging
2012-03-23T15:41:57  <victsou_> so that set_logging wouldn't be too big
2012-03-23T15:41:58  *** Annaa has quit IRC
2012-03-23T15:43:16  <xamox> victsou_, so could we just use logger.setlevel?
2012-03-23T15:43:28  <victsou_> that is possible, yeah
2012-03-23T15:44:01  <xamox> victsou_, Yeah, Nate, our lead developer has always taught me, write the minimum amount of code you can, because in the future it will be less code you have to maintain
2012-03-23T15:44:32  <victsou_> hm... is that about set_logging?
2012-03-23T15:44:38  <xamox> victsou_, Other than that, looking really good.  Just feel free to issue a pull request when you see fit. I probably won't get around to it until this weekend though
2012-03-23T15:44:47  <victsou_> okidokie
2012-03-23T15:44:54  <xamox> time for lunch for me
2012-03-23T15:44:58  <victsou_> me too!

2012-03-23T17:31:46  <dhanush> had a connection problem
2012-03-23T17:32:04  <jayrambhia> dhanush, so what do you need help with ?
2012-03-23T17:32:07  <IRrupTpr> could you point out from error  what the problem
2012-03-23T17:32:14  <IRrupTpr> [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'lenna'
2012-03-23T17:32:30  *** Gaboose has joined #simplecv
2012-03-23T17:32:35  <dhanush> i want to know what do i need to do to get into a project?
2012-03-23T17:32:43  <jayrambhia> IRrupTpr, I guess, the default path hasn't properly set
2012-03-23T17:33:11  <dhanush> like if im submitting a proposal this time. what is expected of me?
2012-03-23T17:33:24  <IRrupTpr> have you gone through the code
2012-03-23T17:33:30  <jayrambhia> dhanush, I am not a mentor. and I am trying same thing. As told by mentors, you need to learn how simplecv works, and make some good examples using it
2012-03-23T17:33:43  <jayrambhia> IRrupTpr, which code ? ImageClass ?
2012-03-23T17:33:49  <dhanush> ok.
2012-03-23T17:33:57  <dhanush> so what else?
2012-03-23T17:33:57  <IRrupTpr> whole Skeleton of it
2012-03-23T17:34:23  <jayrambhia> IRrupTpr, yeah. but not how it builds its library.
2012-03-23T17:34:56  <IRrupTpr> well check imageclass line 149 to 154
2012-03-23T17:34:58  <jayrambhia> dhanush, make something that can be used in simplecv and submit a patch or something like that
2012-03-23T17:35:03  <jayrambhia> IRrupTpr, okay
2012-03-23T17:35:03  <jayrambhia> wait
2012-03-23T17:35:25  <dhanush> can you give me an example?
2012-03-23T17:35:47  <jayrambhia> dhanush, as in ? what example ?
2012-03-23T17:35:50  <IRrupTpr> there is source as an object
2012-03-23T17:36:01  <jayrambhia>       >>> imgs.load("images/eyes", "png")
2012-03-23T17:36:01  <jayrambhia>       """

2012-03-23T17:36:02  <jayrambhia>         return
2012-03-23T17:36:40  <jayrambhia> I have updated my ImageClass file with fourier branch
2012-03-23T17:36:43  <dhanush> like what kind of patch or demo example?
2012-03-23T17:36:47  <IRrupTpr> in __init__(self, source, camera, colorSpace)     149         elif (type(source) == type(str()) and source != ''):     150             self.filename = source --> 151             self._bitmap = cv.LoadImage(self.filename, iscolor=cv.CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR)     152             self._colorSpace = ColorSpace.BGR
2012-03-23T17:37:07  <IRrupTpr> this is the code which causing the prob
2012-03-23T17:37:07  <xamox> IRrupTpr, Ahh, I think i know.  Try img = Image('simplecv')
2012-03-23T17:37:15  <xamox> I think lenna has been added recently and isn't in 1.2
2012-03-23T17:37:49  <xamox> ezod, thanks, I'll let you know.
2012-03-23T17:38:23  <jayrambhia> xamox, IRrupTpr what difference will that make ?
2012-03-23T17:39:14  <xamox> jayrambhia, will not having the latest?
2012-03-23T17:39:28  <jayrambhia> ?
2012-03-23T17:39:44  <xamox> jayrambhia, not sure I understand your question
2012-03-23T17:40:15  <jayrambhia> xamox, you asked IRrupTpr to use img = Image('simplecv'). what difference will it make ? it's the same thing
2012-03-23T17:41:00  <IRrupTpr> xamox tell where is source defined
2012-03-23T17:41:28  <IRrupTpr> no it may be thta i didn't have this oimage
2012-03-23T17:41:46  <IRrupTpr> but simplecv is for sure
2012-03-23T17:41:59  <IRrupTpr> may be due version diff
2012-03-23T17:42:09  <jayrambhia> IRrupTpr, that's what I have been telling you to do. Try to load an image which is in your computer
2012-03-23T17:42:28  <IRrupTpr> well i am trying dear
2012-03-23T17:42:44  <IRrupTpr> xamox tell me
2012-03-23T17:43:30  <IRrupTpr> where is this source object is defined in class ImageClass
2012-03-23T17:43:48  <IRrupTpr> or from which class it is imported
2012-03-23T17:44:28  <jayrambhia> IRrupTpr, dude. source is what you pass as a parameter
2012-03-23T17:45:38  <IRrupTpr> well i am talking about where is this default directory is defined
2012-03-23T17:45:50  <IRrupTpr> would u tell me
2012-03-23T17:47:14  <jayrambhia> /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/SimpleCV-1.2.0-py2.7
2012-03-23T17:47:20  <jayrambhia> check this directory
2012-03-23T17:47:36  <xamox> IRrupTpr,
2012-03-23T17:47:39  <jayrambhia> or something similar directory in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/
2012-03-23T17:47:39  <xamox> import SimpleCV
2012-03-23T17:47:43  <xamox> SimpleCV.__file__
2012-03-23T17:47:55  <xamox> That will tell you where simplecv is installed
2012-03-23T17:48:04  <xamox> It's in a subfolder called images
2012-03-23T17:48:07  <xamox> sorry
2012-03-23T17:48:10  <xamox> 'sampleimages'
2012-03-23T17:48:55  <xamox> They can also be found and downloaded directly from the repo: https://github.com/ingenuitas/SimpleCV/tree/master/SimpleCV/sampleimages
2012-03-23T17:49:16  <xamox> It isn't loading them from a file
2012-03-23T17:49:21  <xamox> doing this
2012-03-23T17:49:24  <xamox> img = Image('simplecv')
2012-03-23T17:49:42  <xamox> actually loads a string and converts it to an iamge
2012-03-23T17:49:46  <xamox> that way we can store images in code
2012-03-23T17:49:48  <xamox> :)
2012-03-23T17:50:01  <xamox> And they can live agonistic of any operating system you are onn

2012-03-23T20:02:45  <kscottz> Well eye, face, mouth, etc detection are done
2012-03-23T20:02:59  <jayrambhia> in simplecv ?
2012-03-23T20:03:08  <kscottz> Yeah

2012-03-23T20:03:43  <jayrambhia> yeah. actually i used it for face detection

2012-03-23T20:05:09  <kscottz> it isn't that hard
2012-03-23T20:05:38  <kscottz> The haar cascades are on github
2012-03-23T20:05:38  <jayrambhia> yeah. my code is kind of working. but sometimes giving false positives
2012-03-23T20:05:55  <kscottz> false positives on face detection?
2012-03-23T20:06:02  <jayrambhia> no. on eyes
2012-03-23T20:06:23  <kscottz> yeah false positves are part of the game
2012-03-23T20:06:34  *** frank4591 has joined #simplecv
2012-03-23T20:06:37  <kscottz> One cool thing you could do for a script
2012-03-23T20:06:45  <jayrambhia> kscottz, what ? what ?
2012-03-23T20:06:53  <kscottz> is to get the eyes and guess the eye color
2012-03-23T20:07:00  <kscottz> and then guess the hair and skin color too
2012-03-23T20:07:12  <jayrambhia> kscottz, oh yeah. that would be a good idea
2012-03-23T20:07:17  <kscottz> yeah
2012-03-23T20:07:41  <kscottz> I bet in 100 lines you could have a start of a face recognitoin system (i.e. recognize people)
2012-03-23T20:07:52  <kscottz> There is a technique called aggregate soft biometrics
2012-03-23T20:08:47  <kscottz> basically the technique says, that if you can make a bunch of weak detectors, like things that can tell eye color, big nose vs. small nose, hair color... etc that if you get enough of those weak detectors they are good enough to recognize people
2012-03-23T20:09:04  <kscottz> Versus using one of the eigen face based approaches
2012-03-23T20:09:05  <jayrambhia> kscottz, one my seniors had done this project, in which he recognized whether eyes were drowsy or not ? and he implemented this in a car system, so whenever the eyes were found drowsy, it meant either driver is drunk or sleepy so car would stop
2012-03-23T20:09:23  <kscottz> yeah
2012-03-23T20:09:34  <kscottz> Gaze tracking is really popoular
2012-03-23T20:09:40  <kscottz> actually hang on a sec
2012-03-23T20:11:15  <jayrambhia> kscottz, so bunch of weak detectors applied at once to detect eye color, nose shape and stuff, and it might be a good, not that efficient, but good tool to identify people

2012-03-23T20:33:18  <kamal_> kscottz, I sent a draft project proposal to gsoc<__AT __>ingenuitas.com to get some feed back and suggestions, I am interested in improving machine learning librarary - especially adding unsupervised learning algorithms and PGM models ...
2012-03-23T20:33:57  <kscottz> hold on.... ket me look
2012-03-23T20:36:45  <kscottz> Kamal.... this looks good
2012-03-23T20:36:48  <kscottz> There is one thing
2012-03-23T20:37:16  <kscottz> So I need you to "wrap" your project into some sort of practical problem.
2012-03-23T20:37:30  <kscottz> Like I want to use computer vision to do X
2012-03-23T20:37:37  <kscottz> Where X is something that has real world value
2012-03-23T20:37:48  <kamal_> ok
2012-03-23T20:37:57  <kscottz> Like find a problem to solve
2012-03-23T20:38:24  <kscottz> We really want the interns to write good code, but we also want to give them something to show to the world that is cool.
2012-03-23T20:38:50  <kscottz> And let's just say, for example you wanted to use ML to sort fruit
2012-03-23T20:38:57  <kscottz> just as something trivial
2012-03-23T20:39:45  <kscottz> We want to see you go through the process of getting some data, writing a bunch of generic methods that would be useful for solving the problem, and then having a baseline against which to verify your results.
2012-03-23T20:40:01  <kamal_> I implemented code to classify some object groups using simpleCV ML library and hosted in my google code
2012-03-23T20:40:15  <kscottz> yeah I tool a quick look at it
2012-03-23T20:40:31  <kscottz> I'll let you finish
2012-03-23T20:41:02  <kamal_> I am interested in recognizing objects based on context information
2012-03-23T20:41:38  <kamal_> would like to do experiments in that area using SimpleCV
2012-03-23T20:42:31  <kscottz> yeah... my only warning kamal is that context based approaches are not really what we are looking for
2012-03-23T20:43:09  <kscottz> I mean it is a very research geared tasks, you're more than welcome on it if you can give me a couple of real world scenarios that I could out and use that algorithm for tomorrow
2012-03-23T20:44:53  <jayrambhia> kscottz, it's not 6-7 weeks. It's a lot more than that. But still how should it be divided ?
2012-03-23T20:46:01  <kscottz> yeah it should be at least 12 I would think
2012-03-23T20:46:15  <jayrambhia> yeah.
2012-03-23T20:47:06  <kscottz> So figure there will be 2-3 weeks where you will be learning, maybe colleccting some data, maybe 4-5 coding, 2 weeks testing, and a few weeks documenting
2012-03-23T20:47:27  <kscottz> I am not to strict on how you plan, as we all know these things slide around based on what you find.
2012-03-23T20:47:42  <kscottz> It is not like we're just throwing up a website or a database
2012-03-23T20:47:51  <kscottz> These are research-y type tasks
2012-03-23T20:48:07  <kscottz> but plan to have a couple weeks of slack on both sides of the summer
2012-03-23T20:48:10  <jayrambhia> yeah, but still there has to be some timeline.
2012-03-23T20:48:23  <jayrambhia> yeah
2012-03-23T20:49:32  <jayrambhia> kscottz, that you were talking about color clustering, what exactly is it ?
2012-03-23T20:49:47  <jayrambhia> kscottz, that day you were talking about color clustering, what exactly is it ? typos
2012-03-23T20:52:56  <jayrambhia> is letter and number recognition supported by simplecv ?
2012-03-23T20:54:45  <kscottz> sorta
2012-03-23T20:55:18  <kscottz> Uh I just take the colors, toss it in a vector, and do k-means
2012-03-23T20:55:27  <kscottz> Text recognition works sometime
2012-03-23T20:55:44  <khannan> kscottz How is the idea of Tracking an Object using a Kalman Filter, The Actual recognition is done using existing techniques and a Confidence parameter is calculated associated with the number/quality of Features extracted, a direct application of this would be fast object tracking in a noisy environment
2012-03-23T20:56:22  *** Infinity_ has joined #simplecv
2012-03-23T20:56:56  <kscottz> depends on what you mean by features
2012-03-23T20:59:57  <khannan> The Features would ideally support any of the feature extraction methods or even simple segmentation methods, this would only be a framework for setting the confidence parameters, choosing the feature extraction technique etc.
2012-03-23T21:00:53  <khannan> Like in a Simple application like RobboSoccer one would use simple color segmentation techniques to follow the ball
2012-03-23T21:01:42  *** arduix has quit IRC
2012-03-23T21:01:56  <khannan> Or this could be coupled with a TLD like feature extractor to make a closed loop system of tracking
2012-03-23T21:02:24  *** arduix has joined #simplecv
2012-03-23T21:04:07  <khannan> I hope I am not very ambiguous?
2012-03-23T21:05:45  <kscottz> yeah that works
2012-03-23T21:05:50  <kscottz> sorry I am looking at code
2012-03-23T21:07:07  <khannan> Thats alright, I will hopefully have some working code to support this
2012-03-23T21:09:17  <kamal_> yes - I do understand that context based recognition is an research intensive area(won't be suitable for gsoc project) - Object classification is the major computer vision task that is expected to be fulfilled by ML library - the performance will depend on the robustness of the features selected and classifier efficiency - I can download training data set for more general objects and process it through the "train - validate - test
2012-03-23T21:11:04  <khannan> Also on an unrelated note isn't improving the web interface pertinent to the Ipython notebook Project?
2012-03-23T21:11:04  <khannan> or do you mean updating the code for limitations of Notebook such as the lack of an STDIN?
2012-03-23T21:11:43  <khannan> or do you mean updating the code for accomodating limitations of Notebook such as the lack of an STDIN? *typo

2012-03-24T14:47:35  <jayrambhia> rishipyth, because they are examples
2012-03-24T14:47:46  <rishipyth> This actually speeds up solutions
2012-03-24T14:48:18  <jayrambhia> not exactly. The examples are there to let user know how to use simplecv
2012-03-24T14:48:37  <jayrambhia> you just can't have everything directly.

2012-03-24T14:48:58  <rishipyth> Oh..I guess you are correct.
2012-03-24T14:49:06  <jayrambhia> It reduces user liberty and control.

2012-03-24T18:43:36  <Mboyanov> Hello. I'm interested in the machine learning part of simplecv. Is there a need to implement k-means clustering and/or some sort of neural networks? Also,i wanted to ask if this may is already implemented: does the naive bayes classifier store all the parameters or does it extract the decision boundaries?

2012-03-25T17:09:59  <harsh> i would like to make an augmented reality app for mobile device
2012-03-25T17:10:18  <harsh> On focusing the camera over some text written in specified language (which can be later advanced to detect language), the app will smartly replace the text in the real time video to the language specified using Google Translator.
2012-03-25T17:11:14  <harsh> would that be a good idea?
2012-03-25T17:11:49  <jayrambhia> it seems really good idea.
2012-03-25T17:14:18  <harsh> thanx
2012-03-25T17:14:38  <harsh> i have already started working on that
2012-03-25T17:14:44  <jayrambhia> great
2012-03-25T17:15:39  <harsh> do i need to be more specific in my idea while applying?
2012-03-25T17:15:50  <jayrambhia> i guess
2012-03-25T17:17:38  <harsh> ok
2012-03-25T17:21:59  *** arduix has quit IRC
2012-03-25T17:23:04  <harsh> i was also thinking of making an another augmented reality app for devices with good camera
2012-03-25T17:23:42  <harsh> which can detect constellations, connect and highlight them in real time video to have better knowledge enriching experience.
2012-03-25T17:25:34  *** LeLouch16 has joined #simplecv
2012-03-25T17:26:02  <harsh> how would that be?

2012-03-25T17:28:05  *** Nived has joined #simplecv
2012-03-25T17:28:30  <harsh> no but if you have mobile phone.... you focus it on sky
2012-03-25T17:29:09  <jayrambhia> and google sky gives me data about constellations and stuff
2012-03-25T17:29:17  <harsh> and it will connect dots
2012-03-25T17:29:23  <harsh> highlight it

2012-03-25T17:33:52  <jayrambhia> you do have a point
2012-03-25T17:34:13  <jayrambhia> but then camera must have good resolution and zoom and stuff
2012-03-25T17:35:08  *** arduix has joined #simplecv
2012-03-25T17:35:30  <harsh> yeah that wat matters...... so maybe for iphone.... it would be an interesting app
2012-03-25T17:35:52  <jayrambhia> yeah
2012-03-25T17:35:55  <harsh> can i submit more than 1 idea
2012-03-25T17:36:07  <jayrambhia> i don't know. I am not a mentor
2012-03-25T17:36:22  <jayrambhia> read FAQs on GSoC website

2012-03-26T15:18:08  <xamox> rishipyth, Yeah, we got more responses then I had thought. Which is a good thing though
2012-03-26T15:20:25  <rishipyth> xamox, congrats. :) i want to clarify something. In the soc page, its written you all are accepting only 3 students. Is it that each of the mentors are accepting 3 students or is the whole organisation accepting only 3 students?
2012-03-26T15:26:02  *** crescendo_ has quit IRC
2012-03-26T15:41:28  <xamox> rishipyth, probably whole organization
2012-03-26T15:41:46  <xamox> rishipyth, we have 3 core developers, and each one will probably have a student assigned to them

2012-03-26T16:02:31  <scari> Hi all, HI, I'm Arun Scaria from India. Final year CS engineering student. In previous GSOC, I successfully completed my project with FEDORA under the mentoring of 'stephen gallagher'. The project was in Linux-C 'SUDO integration to SSSD'. I have fair working experience in python too. I've worked on Google app engine(Python API) and  a python lib module on SSL/TLS protocol, which was my final year project. I would like to discuss about the idea 'Panorama /
2012-03-26T16:02:31  <scari>  Image Stitching '.
2012-03-26T16:04:30  <scari> While searching in the net, I found a number of stitching algorithms. Do you have any algorithm in importance?? Or can I suggest any??

2012-03-26T16:17:55  <xamox> scari, We would probably opt for simplicity over speed first
2012-03-26T16:18:13  <xamox> Given the time frame for the project, I would say more than one could be implemented
2012-03-26T16:19:01  <scari> xamox: Do you have any specific algorithm in mind which is a must include?

2012-03-26T17:26:54  <xamox> LeLouch16, Absolutely. In fact I would love to have that ported to Simplecv
2012-03-26T17:27:04  <xamox> LeLouch16, There is an example in scikits-learn
2012-03-26T17:27:26  <xamox> LeLouch16, I would love to use that with our face detector demo, where it finds the face, then compares to a database
2012-03-26T17:27:36  <LeLouch16> Oh Thanks :) I will look at it
2012-03-26T17:27:39  <xamox> since we both support Numpy arrays

2012-03-26T18:23:35  <xamox> if you git remote add

2012-03-26T20:02:45  <khannan> ChrisCTX: How did you resolve your own query?
2012-03-26T20:03:10  <khannan> I'm having the same doubt
2012-03-26T20:04:09  <khannan> Gaboose: once you send a pull request you get an id
2012-03-26T20:04:23  <Gaboose> but there's already an issue raised on that topic?
2012-03-26T20:04:31  <Gaboose> do i still have to create a new one?
2012-03-26T20:04:58  <Gaboose> I mean, my pull request will show up in the issues as well right?
2012-03-26T20:06:58  <khannan> yes! I am guessing that once your request is accepted and merged, the older issue will be closed by the mods
2012-03-26T20:08:20  <khannan> or u can post your pull reference id as solved in the issue post? better confirm with someone

2012-03-26T20:32:53  <Roman___> Hi! I have questions on the Tracking project. For this project should be to write only new features or may write ml algorithms (HOG or Viola Jones)
2012-03-26T20:33:17  <jayrambhia> isnt Viola Jones same as Haar ?
2012-03-26T20:33:20  <kscottz> you can write whatever you want
2012-03-26T20:33:33  <kscottz> But you don't get to re-invent the wheel
2012-03-26T20:33:53  <kscottz> and you don't get to create a big ball of wax, you need to make modules that can and will be re-used
2012-03-26T20:34:03  *** atneik_ has joined #simplecv
2012-03-26T20:34:21  <mboyanov> Hello. Could I just ask a quickie on the current machine learning part of the code. Does the Naive Bayes Classifier store all the parameters used in training or does it extract the decision boundaries?
2012-03-26T20:34:42  <kscottz> Oooh, good question
2012-03-26T20:34:58  <kscottz> I am not sure... but I think it should just be the decision boundaries..
2012-03-26T20:35:01  <kscottz> Why do you ask
2012-03-26T20:35:01  <kscottz> ?
2012-03-26T20:35:20  <Roman___> isnt Viola Jones same as Haar yes Viola Jones use Haar features
2012-03-26T20:35:24  <mboyanov> I was just going to mention it in my application as a possible improvement
2012-03-26T20:35:45  <mboyanov> amongst implementation of other algorithms
2012-03-26T20:36:33  <kscottz> Moyanov, how is that an improvement? (I am asking more rhetorically).
2012-03-26T20:39:49  *** xamox has joined #simplecv
2012-03-26T20:39:50  <mboyanov> Well, it's an improvement on memory required after training is complete and possibly on runtime of classification. At least I think it's faster?
2012-03-26T20:40:23  <kscottz> Okay... I think this needs to be said, to all of the GSoC kids
2012-03-26T20:40:36  <kscottz> The order in which care about features and projects
2012-03-26T20:40:44  <kscottz> Highest Priority
2012-03-26T20:40:56  <kscottz> (1) FEATURE IS USEFUL IN THE REAL WORLD
2012-03-26T20:41:00  <kscottz> (2) FEATURE WORKS
2012-03-26T20:41:15  <kscottz> (3) FEATURE IS DOCUMENTED AND TESTED
2012-03-26T20:41:27  <kscottz> (4) FEATURE RUNS IN MEMORY CONSTRAINS
2012-03-26T20:41:39  <kscottz> (4) FEATURE RUNS QUICKLY
2012-03-26T20:41:43  <kscottz> er that is 5
2012-03-26T20:41:54  <kscottz> (6) FEATURE IS ACADEMICALLY INTERESTING
2012-03-26T20:42:30  <kscottz> The last three things are trivial in our mind, compared to the first three
2012-03-26T20:44:16  <Gaboose> doesn't that apply to what mboyanov said?
2012-03-26T20:44:52  <kscottz> Uhg, I didn't phrase that quite right, basically what I am trying to say is that if you propose a project that makes existing code run faster, or something that has no immediate applications in the real world we will pitch it in the bin
2012-03-26T20:45:34  <kscottz> Same goes for if you want to completely rehash something that has been done before and has no immediate application for us.
2012-03-26T20:46:09  <kscottz> If the project does not have immediate applications in security, manufacturing, or the bio-sciences we're probably not as interested.
2012-03-26T20:46:10  *** xamox has quit IRC
2012-03-26T20:46:45  <kscottz> To that end I don't care about having 15 flavors of machine learning unless I can use them in the real world.
2012-03-26T20:47:55  <kscottz> That's not to say that we don't want you to do them, but it is more to say that your project needs to show where and how a paricular ml/cv method can be used.

2012-03-26T20:52:49  <khannan> kscottz: Those fields were just arbitrary examples (security, manufacturing, or the bio-sciences) are arbitrary right? As in its fine if the application is in another realworld field?
2012-03-26T20:53:38  <kscottz> If it is good
2012-03-26T20:54:09  <kscottz> If someone want to count goats going into and out of a barn with computer vision I would say go for it
2012-03-26T20:54:29  <kscottz> especially if the kid said, hey I want to try these three methods for tracking the goats
2012-03-26T20:54:41  <ChrisCTX> ^ detects if horses/animals get out of pen/stable
2012-03-26T20:54:43  <ChrisCTX> :P
2012-03-26T20:55:03  <kscottz> This is useful for farming and a lot of other domains
2012-03-26T20:55:26  <kscottz> And the modules you would need to write should be generically applicable to a lot of domains.
2012-03-26T20:55:50  <kscottz> And we would have a metric to evaluate the performance of the algorithms
2012-03-26T20:56:03  <ChrisCTX> good luck keeping track of goats though :P http://www.odditycentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/tree_goats2.jpg
2012-03-26T20:56:42  <kscottz> If you don't have a benchmark by which you evaluate your algorithms you can't make real progress.
2012-03-26T20:56:58  <kscottz> Computer vision is great, when it works
2012-03-26T20:57:35  <kscottz> Our criteria is that our algorithms work, speed, memory foot print, and academic interestingness are secondary.
2012-03-26T20:58:17  <khannan> So can I send in a few draft proposals, It would be great to have your feedback so I could improve on it?
2012-03-26T20:58:56  <kscottz> I will try as best I can
2012-03-26T20:59:00  <kscottz> I am getting swamped
2012-03-26T20:59:13  <Gaboose> what do you mean by benchmark? what would that be in the goat example?
2012-03-26T20:59:29  <kscottz> Does it correctly count the goats or not.
2012-03-26T20:59:39  <kscottz> This sounds like it should be easy... but it really is not
2012-03-26T21:00:01  <kscottz> i.e. you are going to manually count the gotas
2012-03-26T21:00:24  <kscottz> and then compare your algorithm against what you saw. If it gets the wrong number it sucks.
2012-03-26T21:00:49  <kscottz> This is the key to computer vision... it has to work 99.999% of the time
2012-03-26T21:00:55  <kscottz> If it doesn't it is useless.
2012-03-26T21:01:08  <ChrisCTX> will the mentors check the proposals on a daily basis, or will they do so until the proposal time is closed?
2012-03-26T21:01:24  <kscottz> And if you can't tell me how well it performs on a given task, or how two methods compare, then you are doing something wrong
2012-03-26T21:01:36  <kscottz> I am pretty sure this is what is going to happen.
2012-03-26T21:01:47  <kscottz> We'll wait until they are all in.
2012-03-26T21:02:14  <kscottz> I will go through and throw out all the ones that completely suck, or the kids did not provide the need information.
2012-03-26T21:02:47  <kscottz> Then Nate, Anthony and I will probably take the best 12-18, get a six pack of beer and go through them with a fine tooth comb.
2012-03-26T21:02:56  *** josh_ has quit IRC
2012-03-26T21:03:09  <kscottz> We'll probably have six slots. And try to assign the kids to slots
2012-03-26T21:03:18  <ChrisCTX> sounds good
2012-03-26T21:03:22  <Gaboose> six! i thought there were three
2012-03-26T21:03:33  <kscottz> Google doesn't tell us.
2012-03-26T21:03:35  <ChrisCTX> I did too, but I don't mind better chances :P
2012-03-26T21:03:45  <kscottz> I really want to have three kids who can come to Ann Arbor
2012-03-26T21:04:10  <kscottz> but baring that, we'll pick a few kids that we feel we can work with remotely
2012-03-26T21:04:32  <kscottz> We might also try to help out a couple of PhD students who we thing can write a cool paper using SimpleCV

2012-03-26T21:09:15  <Gaboose> do the students have to know how to implement their ideas from start to finish when proposing them?
2012-03-26T21:13:39  <Gaboose> that's probably a stupid question

2012-03-26T21:29:30  <kscottz> Just for two weeks? No, not a problem.

2012-03-26T21:29:58  <kscottz> I would _love_ to go to Iran.
2012-03-26T21:30:08  <khannan> Thanks a lot, I'm relieved!
2012-03-26T21:30:20  <kscottz> If anything put a note in your application
2012-03-26T21:30:31  <kscottz> Just so we know that if we email you we won't get a response
2012-03-26T21:30:38  <khannan> Yeah its my first time too there!
2012-03-26T21:31:00  <kscottz> Where do you live now?
2012-03-26T21:31:21  <khannan> I'll try to respond at night but wont be able to work on any code I think since I will be busy with the event
2012-03-26T21:31:29  <khannan> in India

2012-03-26T21:33:24  <ChrisCTX> sad when political/cultural issues get in the way of fun stuff
2012-03-26T21:33:35  <khannan> I am sure you will get a chance once this political issue is sorted, meanwhile you can come to India, we'll be pleased to have you here
2012-03-26T21:33:36  <ChrisCTX> you making a robot khannan?
2012-03-26T21:34:27  <kscottz> I was going to go to India a few months ago, but my mom got sick and I had to cancel. I was pretty bummed.
2012-03-26T21:34:33  <khannan> yes I'll be participating in teensize soccer playing humanoid competition
2012-03-26T21:36:48  <khannan> Hope you can make it along with your Mom soon
2012-03-26T21:38:51  <khannan> It would mean a great deal to work with you, I am blown away by your template resume in Gsoc application page, I'll try my best
